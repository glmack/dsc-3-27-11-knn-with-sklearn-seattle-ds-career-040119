    "## Why Use sklearn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN is a simple algorithm, and one that we've already written our own implementation of, you may be wondering why we should even bother using sklearn when we have already written our version of KNN. The answer lies in optimization. In the case of KNN, you'll find sklearn's implementation to be much more robust and fast, because of optimzations such as caching distances in clever ways that their algorithm performs under the hood.

    "## Using the sklearn Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, you should familiarize yourself with any documentation available for any libraries or frameworks you use. For every algorithm, you'll find a general [documentation page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) which tells you things such as the inputs, parameters, outputs, and caveats of any algorithm. However, you'll also find very informative [User Guides](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#classification) that explain both how the algorithm works, and how to best use it, complete with sample code! \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following image can be found in the sklearn User Guide for K-Nearest Neighbors, along with an explanation of how different parameters can affect the overall performance of the model. \n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we did just about everything from scratch in section, you'll find that sklearn provides robust implementations for things such as evaluation metrics.  No need to worry about calculating your own F1-score--there's a function for that! \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in the next lab, you'll want to focus on the overall Data Science Process--not get bogged down in the implementation of any one algorithm. In the final lab for this section, we'll focus on loading, exploring, cleaning, modeling, and evaluating a dataset from start to finish. Try to focus on the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What decisions do I need to make regarding my data? How might these decisions affect overall performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which predictors do I need? How can I confirm that I have the right predictors?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What parameter values (if any) should I choose for my model? How can I find the optimal value for a given parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What metrics will I use to evaluate the performance of my model? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I know if there's room left for improvement with my model? Are the potential performance gains worth the time needed to reach them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Final Note\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling the data in the next lab, you'll be given the opportunity to iterate on your model. Although this section is optional, we **_highly recommend_** you give it a try! Building a model is the easy part--figuring out how to improve it is where the the real challenge lies. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary \n",
    "If you're not sure where to start, as an example, ask yourself some basic questions such as \"will my results be different with unscaled data?\", and then fit another model to unscaled data to answer it! Eventually, you'll start to recognize patterns that will help you gain a more complete understanding of the algorithms you're using, as well as a more complete understanding of data science as a process!"
